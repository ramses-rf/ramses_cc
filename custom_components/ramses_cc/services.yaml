# integration-wide service calls

bind_device:
  name: Bind a Device
  description: >-
    Bind a device to a CH/DHW controller or a fan/ventilation unit.

    The device will be either a sensor (e.g. temperature, humidity, etc.) or a
    remote (e.g. a 4-way switch).

    It must be included in the known_list and correctly configured with an
    appropriate class and faking enabled.

  fields:
    device_id:
      description: >-
        The device id of the supplicant.

        Heating (CH/DHW) devices ids must start with a well-known device type.
        HVAC devices ids should start with a device type that is consistent with their
        hardware manufacturer's scheme.
      example: 03:123456
      required: true

    offer:
      description: >-
        The command_code / domain_idx pairs for the binding offer.

        If you include '10E0' (device info), ensure the domain id is is set to the
        the hardware manufacturer's oem_code.
      example: '{"30C9": "00"}'
      required: true

    confirm:
      description: >-

      required: false

    device_info:
      description: >-
        The device_info command of the supplicant (needed to complete some bindings).

        This is required if you include 10E0 (device info) within the offer.
        It must be the correct payload for the device class.
      required: false


fake_device:
  name: Fake a RAMSES device (deprecated)
  description: >-
    Fake a device, so that it can then cast state data via HA service calls.

    For example, a faked thermostat can be used as a zone sensor to send an explicitly
    specified current temperature to the controller instead of a real thermostat.

    If required, a virtual device can be created, or you can fake an existing device
    (physical devices will continue to cast state date, and so should be deactivated to
    avoid confusion).

    If required, the device can be caused to immediately engage its binding mode.

  fields:
    device_id:
      name: Device ID
      description: >-
        The device ID (a RAMSES ID, not an entity_id).

      required: true

    create_device:
      name: Enable faking
      description: >-
        Create the device. Raises an exception if the device exists.
        Default is False.

      example: false
      selector:
        boolean


force_update:
  name: Update the System state
  description: >-
    Immediately update the system state, without waiting for the next scheduled update.


send_packet:
  name: Send a Command packet
  description: >-
    Send a completely bespoke RAMSES II command packet from the gateway.

  fields:
    device_id:
      description: >-
        The destination device ID (a RAMSES ID, not an entity_id).
        Use "18:000730" (a sentinel value) to send a broadcast from the gateway.
      example: 01:123456
      required: true

    verb:
      description: 'The packet verb, one of: I, RQ, RP, W (leading space not required).'
      example: RQ
      required: true

# If the service accepts entity IDs, target allows the user to specify entities by

# entity, device, and area selectors
# (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/blueprint/selectors/).
# Entity selector parameters will automatically be applied to device and area, and
# device selector parameters will automatically be applied to area
